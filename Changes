Revision history for Test-Roo

{{$NEXT}}

    [INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES]

    - importing Test::Roo makes the current class a subclass of
      Test::Roo::Class; all methods moved there instead of being exported
    
    - Test::Roo now only exports 'test' and 'run_me'

    - done_testing is never called automatically

    [ADDED]

    - Test::Roo::Class has 'run_tests' method for creating and running
      tests; can be called as object or class method

    - Test::Roo::Class has lazy 'description' attribute for generating
      descriptions from test attributes

    - Added 'each_test' hook for global actions before/after every test
