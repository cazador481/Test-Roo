=head1 NAME

Test::Roo - Composable tests with roles and Moo

=head1 VERSION

version 0.001

=head1 SYNOPSIS

A test file:

    # t/test.t
    use Test::Roo; # loads Moo and Test::More

    use lib 't/lib';

    has class => (
        is      => 'ro',
        default => sub { "Digest::MD5" },
    );

    run_tests(qw/MyTestRole/);

A testing role:

    # t/lib/MyTestRole.pm
    package MyTestRole;
    use Test::Roo::Role; # loads Moo::Role and Test::More

    requires 'class';

    test 'object creation' => sub {
        my $self = shift;
        require_ok( $self->class );
        my $obj  = new_ok( $self->class );
    };

    1;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module allows you to compose L<Test::More> tests from roles.  It is
inspired by the excellent L<Test::Routine> module, but uses L<Moo> instead of
L<Moose>.  This gives most of the benefits without the need for L<Moose> as a
test dependency.

Test files are Moo classes.  You can define any needed test fixtures as Moo
attributes.  You define tests as method modifiers -- similar in concept to
C<subtest> in L<Test::More>, but your test method will be passed the test
object for access to fixture attributes.  You may compose any L<Moo::Role> into
your test to define attributes, require particular methods, or define tests.

This means that you can isolate test I<behaviors> into roles which require
certain test I<fixtures> in order to run.  Your main test file will provide the
fixtures and compose the roles to run.  This makes it easy to reuse test
behaviors.

For example, if you are creating tests for Awesome::Module, you could create
the test behaviors as Awesome::Module::Test::Role and distribute it with
your module.  If another distribution subclasses Awesome::Module, it can
compose the Awesome::Module::Test::Role behavior for its own tests.

No more copying and pasting tests from a super class!  Superclasses define and
share their tests.  Subclasses provide their own fixtures and run the tests.

=head1 USAGE

Importing L<Test::Roo> also loads L<Moo> (which gives you L<strictures> with
fatal warnings and other goodies) and L<Test::More>.  No test plan is
used.  The C<done_testing> function will be called for you automatically.

See also L<Test::Roo::Role> for test role usage.

=head2 Creating fixtures

You can create fixtures with normal Moo syntax.  You can even make them lazy
if you want:

    has fixture => (
        is => 'lazy'
    );

    sub _build_fixture { ... }

This becomes really useful with L<Test::Roo::Role>.  A role could define
the attribute and require the builder method to be provided by the
main test class.

=head2 Setup and teardown

You can add method modifiers around the C<setup> and C<teardown> methods
and these will be run before and after all tests (respectively).

    before  setup     => sub { ... };

    after   teardown  => sub { ... };

Roles may also modify these, so the order that modifiers will be called
will depend on when roles are composed.

=head2 Imported functions

=head3 test

    test $label => sub { ... };

The C<test> function adds a subtest.  The code reference will be called with
the test object as its only argument.

Tests are run in the order declared, so the order of tests from roles will
depend on when they are composed relative to other test declarations.

=head3 run_tests

    run_tests( @optional_roles );

The C<run_tests> function composes an optional list of roles into the
current package, creates an object, calls the setup method (triggering
modifiers), runs the tests, calls the teardown method (triggering
modifiers), and calls C<done_testing>.

Because this is usually at the end of the test file, all attributes,
tests and method modifiers in the main test file will be set up before
roles are composed.  If this isn't what you want, use C<with> earlier
in the file and omit the role from the arguments to C<run_tests>.

=head2 Stub methods

Loading L<Test::Roo> imports three stub methods, C<setup>, C<teardown> and
C<do_it>.  These are used to anchor method modifiers in the testing class and
should not be modified directly.
